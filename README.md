# The Blackjack Game Test - Eduardo Aparicio Cardenes

## Objective
The purpose of this exercise is to create a simple HTML/JavaScript game of 
[blackjack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).

## The Game
Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking 
game in the world. Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and 
dealer, meaning players compete against the dealer but not against other players. 
It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards.

## The Rules
Your game must follow the following simple set of rules:

- When the game starts, the player is given 2 random cards and the dealer is 
given one which the player can see. 
- Each numbered card has its face value, the ace can be either 1 or 11 and picture cards are worth 10 points.
- The player is given the following 2 options: ‘hit’ or ‘stick’. 
⋅⋅* The player can hit or stick until they are either happy with the sum of the values of their cards 
or until the total of their cards add up to 21 or over. If their hand is over 21, 
they lose. 
⋅⋅* Otherwise, if they stick, the dealer will then start drawing cards until 
they either have a closer total to 21. If the dealer goes over then the player wins.

## Tips

- Please model a simple HTML based UI to allow a single player to play this game – 
we are not expecting a polished UI. The purpose of this exercise is to see how 
you model the various concepts of the game inside the application and how you 
design your code. 

- Please feel free to add any extra functionality/enhancements that you think 
would make the game more fun! 

- When complete, please send back all the necessary files for us to evaluate 
the test along with any other supporting information you would like to share.
